README for the code/ folder



1.	Open MySimulation.py module in package.
2.	Specify number of nodes, time of simulation and network configuration.
3.	In the main function of MySimulation.py module, define density of types (L/H).
4.	In the NetworkSimulation module, you can change the number of trials.
5.	In the SIRSAgent module, you are able to change the P_S_base, P_IR_base, P_R_base probabilities and agents behavioral function (like imitation).
6.	Run the MySimulation.py module, you will get the “trial_values_infected.csv” file. (Please notice that the plotted diagram in the result folder, “plot_SIR.png”, is the average over all trials, even non-epidemic trials) 

In Parameters_Configuration_Chart.pdf, the list of all parameters with reference velues and description is present.
